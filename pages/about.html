                    Rouben Axel Charles (Nov 18 1994) is a Canadian born artist that has a certain goal within his art. The fusion between cinema and music has been interlaced indefinitely, 
                    and this is where Rouben will fuse his melodic sound to intertwine with passive storytelling for his audience. This has led Rouben to secure space in the fields of being a producer, 
                    singer/song writer, music engineer, video director, and creative director amongst his art work.
                    <br><br>
                    Finding his passion for film&acting during a drama elective course in high school, Rouben has focused on writing and developing short stories. This direction has lead Rouben to focus
                     on creating songs that develop imagery through lyrics. Stemming from personal experiences, Rouben would like to bring his sound to life by not just letting your ears hear, but by
                      letting your pain, love&devotion, and distressing memories come to life.

                    "When I was a young kid, early 2000's living in Canada. I loved waking up Saturday Mornings to watch BET or MTV music videos.
                    I remembered certain songs just because of how strong the imagery was and how it complemented the sounds...even if I was too young to understand the lyrics. 
                    <span class="bold">"Find your Love - Drake"</span> is still today one of my favourites for simple but connecting cinematic imagery. Also, <span class="bold">"Kelly Rowland - Stole"</span> is one of my favourite 
                    music videos because of the imagery she instilled of young promising men losing their lives over minor problems in our culture.  
                    <br><br>
                    Today, the sound of music has evolved dramatically and those songs now definitely wouldn't get played in the club scene... 
                    but I stream certain songs and watch music videos that date back to that early 2000's era because of the mental connection 
                    and relation I have to them through personal experiences.  For every 5 songs my team develops, I'm trying to go for 1 or 2 
                    cinematic short stories to match. That's all I'm trying to do. Have my music relate."
